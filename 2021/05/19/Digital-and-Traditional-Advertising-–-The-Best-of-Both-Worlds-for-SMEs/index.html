With the increase in mobile phone usage and digital platforms, SMEs are spoilt for choice when it comes to advertising online, and so, traditional media advertising such as television, radio and newspapers is often not their first choice when they want to promote their business.</p>

<p>Data in the chart above shows that the Internet as an advertising medium has experienced a sharp<super>1</super> growth in recent years, as seen from the increase in total advertising expenditure. </p>
<p>Despite the rise of digital platforms and digital advertising, traditional media such as outdoor and in-store advertising spend also increased; and throughout the eight-year period, television and print media (i.e. newspapers and magazines) still remained a large part of media advertising. This is likely due to businesses realising the need to balance their exposure on both digital and non-digital media advertising platforms.</p>
<p>What does this mean for SMEs and can they have the best of both worlds?</p>
<p>In today’s hyper-connected environment where consumers’ attention spans are extremely short, SMEs can no longer afford to simply broadcast their products/services and prices if they hope to stand out from the crowd. To remain competitive, SMEs must find ways to create a relevant and compelling brand image and give their target demographic meaningful content that resonates with them.</p>
<p>SMEs should also consider leveraging traditional media, which is still considered a trustworthy source by many people. While the perception that traditional media is expensive is true to a certain extent, this is mainly because media owners had previously heavily depended on media buying companies for revenue and offer preferential rates to these companies.</p>
<p>Hence, direct media advertising bookings were often more expensive than bookings from media buying agencies who would buy media space and airtime from major media owners and resell it to market, be it multinational companies, SMEs, or even other advertising agencies. This often caused SMEs to be priced out from traditional media.</p>
<p>To bring the best of digital and traditional advertising together for smaller businesses, Adwork launched a revolutionary platform to enable SMEs to explore both channels at extremely competitive prices. </p>
<p>Adwork is able to do so because it partners directly with media owners to obtain rates that are typically offered only to media buying agencies and large advertisers. Adding to its value, SMEs are also offered free advertising space on traditional media so that business owners can try out its effectiveness for themselves – a move that was previously unheard of.  </p>
<p>As a company that partners with media owners to provide dedicated solutions for SMEs, this means that SME owners can use Adwork to buy any media related products – from Facebook advertising, cinema advertising, billboard space, airtime on a talk show, or even writing and translation services – directly on its platform. </p>
<p>With the help of an end-to-end advertising platform that has its own proprietary media planning tool, SMEs can now focus on planning their next advertising campaign without any worries as they will have access to all media types at affordable prices that will keep them within budget.</p>
