<p>A long time ago (as early as the 1800s), advertising agencies started ‘media buying’ – acting as brokers who handled the placement of advertisements in different newspapers. Over the years, these agencies began to buy media space and airtime from various media owners including newspapers, television, radio and billboards, before reselling it to other advertising agencies and advertisers.</p>
<p>Today, advertising agencies still play an intermediary role but its function has since evolved to also support businesses in several aspects such as strategic planning, content curation and media buying. </p>
<p>However, established media buying agencies tend to focus on big-name advertisers with large budgets, and in the process, overlook SMEs who have long been priced out of traditional advertising media.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the increasing accessibility of the Internet in the 2000s gave rise to digital advertising, and now in 2021, advertisers have numerous cost-friendly options to choose from, with Google, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube being some of the most popular mediums.</p>
<p>This presents a new set of challenges for SMEs, particularly those owned and operated by the older generation who may not be as technologically savvy as the younger ones. Digital advertising may be affordable for these smaller businesses, but the lack of information on the various media available and the sheer number of choices in the market can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>SME owners most likely also have limited access to cost-effective rates for different media, making it difficult for them to get the most value for their money. Planning for media buys across various media based on their budget is already tough enough; surely advertising agencies would be able to provide more support to SMEs in this area? </p>
<p>Adwork, which was launched in late 2019, aims to do just that. A revolutionary platform built to support SMEs in manoeuvring the confusing – and at times expensive – media advertising industry, Adwork provides a media planning tool to help SMEs plan their own media strategy based on their specific budget. With more than 10,000 advertising media to choose from on a single platform, advertisers can pick what works for them and get the best deals from exciting new promotions. </p>
